# Pixel Game World
This game simulator is not about winning or losing. Here you can just enjoy playing with your avatar and gather energy by colliding on delicious fruits from the trees.

# Usage
* Begin with a full energy bar at 100%.
* Use the spacebar in order to jump, and use left and right arrow keys to maneuver your avatar.
* Exit the game at any time by pressing the "esc" button.
* Actions requiring energy will only be performed if sufficient energy is available.
* Run mode - Loses half a point of energy when the avatar moves horizontally.
* Jump mode - each leap costs 10 energy points. You can't jump again while still in the air.
* Idle mode - Gains 1 point of energy when the avatar doesn't move.
* Collision with fruit - rewards 10 points of energy.

# Features
* The trees are randomly placed with a 10% probability on each ground block.
* Transition between day and night cycles every 30 seconds.
* Each time your avatar collides with a fruit, that fruit vanishes for 30 seconds, and the player gain 10 points of energy.
* When the avatar jumps, it changes the colors of the fruits and terrain, while the leaves rotate by 90Â°
